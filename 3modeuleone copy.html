            Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to vaporize materials, resulting in a cut edge. While typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, it is now used by schools, small businesses, architecture, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the laser beam to the material. A commercial laser for cutting materials uses a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material.

            Laser Cutting is a very meticulous process. It requires Laser Cutting Machine as well as a software to guide the machine. The one used in our lab is developed by Suresh Indu Lasers Pvt. Ltd. There are many software options available such as LightBurn, LaserCAD, CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, etc. The software we are using in the lab is LASERCAD.

            Why LaserCAD?
            LaserCAD is a leading software solution for laser cutting and engraving, often provided by manufacturers of laser cutting machines. It offers vector drawing tools for creating intricate designs, supports image processing for detailed engraving, and includes a material library for optimal cutting parameters. With a user-friendly interface and compatibility with specific laser cutting machines, LaserCAD streamlines the design and production process, making it a comprehensive tool for laser cutting applications.

        <div class="text2"><p style="font-size: 30px;color:#ffffff;margin: 80px;text-align: center; margin-top: -20px;">On day 3 of our class, our instructor delved further into the intricacies of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), expanding our understanding of its advanced concepts and techniques. Building upon the foundation laid in previous sessions, we delved into more complex selectors, including pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, which allow for finer control over styling specific states and parts of elements.  By the end of the day, we had gained a deeper understanding of CSS and its capabilities, equipping us with the skills to tackle more complex styling challenges in our web development projects.
