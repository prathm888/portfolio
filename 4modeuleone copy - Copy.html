            Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to vaporize materials, resulting in a cut edge. While typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, it is now used by schools, small businesses, architecture, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the laser beam to the material. A commercial laser for cutting materials uses a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material.

            Laser Cutting is a very meticulous process. It requires Laser Cutting Machine as well as a software to guide the machine. The one used in our lab is developed by Suresh Indu Lasers Pvt. Ltd. There are many software options available such as LightBurn, LaserCAD, CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, etc. The software we are using in the lab is LASERCAD.

            Why LaserCAD?
            LaserCAD is a leading software solution for laser cutting and engraving, often provided by manufacturers of laser cutting machines. It offers vector drawing tools for creating intricate designs, supports image processing for detailed engraving, and includes a material library for optimal cutting parameters. With a user-friendly interface and compatibility with specific laser cutting machines, LaserCAD streamlines the design and production process, making it a comprehensive tool for laser cutting applications.

            All members were divided into groups of 4, for this module. For our first cut, we were told to use simple designs so as to familiarize with the machine
             functions and the software interface. We were given quite the liberty to chose our own designs and so we chose a Mandala Pattern as our first. 
            <2D screenshot>
            
            We designed it in the Fusion 360 software since we are now used to it and exported into .dxf file. This file was then imported into the LaserCAD software. After properly setting dimensions, we downloaded the file into the machine. Guided by our instructors, we successfully created our first ever laser cut.

            Next on the agenda was Engraving an image on cardboard. We began the day with a comprehensive overview of the cardboard engraving process, discussing the types of images suitable for engraving and the optimal settings for achieving desired results. A detailed tutorial was provided on using the LaserCAD software, covering image import, setting parameters such as speed and power, and previewing the engraving process. 
            
            We had ample opportunity for hands-on practice, experimenting with different settings and techniques to engrave various images onto cardboard substrates. Throughout the session, instructors provided guidance on troubleshooting common issues encountered during engraving, such as inconsistent burns or incomplete etching. We chose the divine image of Lord Hanuman for our Engraving.

            This was the most exciting part of this module. This time we stepped into the world of 3D Models. We explored the intricacies of laser cutting techniques, mastering the art of transforming raw cardboard sheets into intricate shapes and structures. The precision of the laser cutter allowed us to bring our designs to life with unparalleled accuracy, from simple prototypes to complex architectural models.

            We ended up choosing a simple model for our workshop, but it was still very satisfying seeing the model come to life. The model we chose was a simple biplane, the kind you would often see in video games. I was magnificent to see it out of the world of 2D images and become a 3D model for our project.

            Our final project culminated in the creation of a stunning 3D cardboard eagle model, a testament to the skills and creativity honed throughout the workshop. Drawing inspiration from the majestic beauty of eagles, we embarked on a journey to craft a lifelike representation that would capture their essence in intricate detail. Utilizing advanced laser cutting techniques, we meticulously carved out each component of the eagle, paying careful attention to proportions and structural integrity.

            The assembly process was a true test of our precision and patience, as we delicately pieced together each component to form the majestic silhouette of the eagle in flight. As the final touches were applied, our cardboard eagle soared to life, a testament to the limitless potential of laser cutting technology and the boundless creativity of our team. Standing tall and proud, our model serves as a reminder of the beauty and resilience of nature, captured in a medium as humble yet versatile as cardboard.
